## What should I do if my document doesn't convert correctly

1. Strip the Word Document down to isolate the troublesome part (e.g., remove the parts that are converting correctly)
2. Upload the `.doc` or `.docx` file to someplace like DropBox
3. [Open a new issue](https://github.com/benbalter/word-to-markdown/issues/new) describing the particular problem. Be sure to include a link to the uploaded file.

A few tips for reporting conversion issues:

* Explain the expected output, actual output, and steps to reproduce
* Include screenshots of the expected and actual output
* Issues should be limited to one conversation error and describe it in detail
* Issues that report "My document won't convert" or "I have these three problems" are less likely to be resolved quickly
* Be sure to include what version of Microsoft Word was used to create the document
